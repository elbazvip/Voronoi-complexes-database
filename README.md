# Voronoi-complexes-database
This repository contains several Voronoi's complexes associated to some modular groups (as $GL_N(Z)$ or $SL_N(Z)$ for $N&lt;12$).
It is related to the work of Dutour Sikiric, Elbaz-Vincent, Kupers and Martinet; Vorono{\i} complexes in higher dimensions, cohomology of $GL_N(Z)$ for $N\geq 8$ and the triviality of $K_8(Z)$. 	arXiv:1910.11598
The database from the  work of Elbaz-Vincent, Gangl and Soul√© for $N<8$ is available at the url below
